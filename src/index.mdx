# Hailstorm

## Overview

Hailstorm is the Abusix design system: React 19 components, design tokens, and
Storybook documentation that keep UI consistent, accessible, and fast to ship.
The system emphasizes predictable APIs, token-driven styling, and WCAG-aligned
patterns.

## What this system optimizes for

- Reusable components with stable, typed props.
- Token-first styling (semantic color, spacing, typography).
- Figma Variables-to-production alignment with a clear token pipeline.
- Accessibility-first UI patterns (WCAG 2.2 AA, keyboard, ARIA, focus states).
- Documentation that scales with product velocity (Storybook + MDX).
- Reliable QA with unit tests, a11y checks, and Storybook examples.

## Modernization focus

This release brings the legacy system forward with a full stack refresh:
React 19, Tailwind v4 tokens, Storybook 10, and Vitest-based testing. The goal
is to keep component APIs stable while upgrading the delivery pipeline, token
strategy, and accessibility defaults (WCAG 2.2 AA aligned). The modernization
also strengthens governance: clearer API contracts, predictable releases, and
component-level coverage across the public surface.

## Stack

- React 19 + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS v4 tokens in `src/styles/index.css`
- Headless UI for accessible primitives
- Storybook 10 + MDX for docs and component demos
- Vitest + Testing Library + Playwright browser mode for component tests
- Rollup library builds with Vite for local dev

## Quick start

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm storybook
```

## Development

```bash
pnpm test
pnpm lint
pnpm run build
```

## Docs

Core documentation and examples live in Storybook. Look under `Assets/Icons`
for the icons gallery and `Foundations` for global styles and tokens.
